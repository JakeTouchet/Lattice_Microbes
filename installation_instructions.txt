# Portable conda build

Install Anaconda 3 if not already installed on your computer, download and follow the instructions at
https://www.anaconda.com/

If you want to do spatial RDME simulations which require GPUs, install CUDA, download and instructions can be found at
https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads

Add the following line at the end of /.bashrc so LM can find CUDA.  If path to CUDA is different, export path to where CUDA is installed:
export PATH="/usr/local/cuda/bin/:$PATH"
    
The conda environment can be created from the yml file included here.  Go into the file and change "lmpretest" to whatever you want your environment name to be, then run:

    conda env create -n envname -f lm_precomp.yml
    
    conda activate envname
    
NOT RECOMMENDED: You can also make your Anaconda environment with your choice of name "envname" using Python 3 through the following procedure:
    conda create -n envname -c conda-forge python=3.7.3
    conda activate envname
    conda install -c conda-forge -y git==2.33.1 gcc_linux-64==7.3.0 gxx_linux-64==7.3.0 binutils_linux-64==2.31.1 libstdcxx-ng==11.2.0 libgcc-ng==11.2.0
    conda install -c anaconda hdf5==1.10.4 h5py==2.10.0 protobuf==3.13.0.1
    conda install -c conda-forge -y numpy==1.19.2 cython==0.29.4 cmake==3.14.0 xlrd==1.2.0 swig==4.0.2 jupyter==1.0.0 matplotlib==3.4.3 ipywidgets==7.6.5 tqdm==4.62.3 pillow==8.3.2 jinja2==3.0.2 scipy==1.5.2 pybind11==2.8.1 pandas==1.3.4 pytables==3.5.2 biopython==1.79
    
Once you have created and activated your environment, go to a directory where you want to build Lattice Microbes and do the build running the following commands:
(You do not need to run simulations where the build is located, lm will be installed in your environment as an executable)
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ../Lattice-Microbes/src/ -D MPD_GLOBAL_T_MATRIX=True -D MPD_GLOBAL_R_MATRIX=True
    # The -D flags can be removed if you build with smaller transition matrix and reaction matrix size limits in the cmake options.
    make
    make install
    # Run make install as root or sudo if possible
    
    
Check to make sure the installation worked, run:
    lm --help
    # Should return help commands for lm

There are example executable simulation files in example_rdme_files.
